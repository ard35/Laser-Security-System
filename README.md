# Laser-Security-System
This is a PYTHON program, which is uploaded to a Raspberry Pi on the Thonny IDE. A photoresistor checks for a laser light. In normal conditions, a green LED and a shell message of "System OK" is produced. If the laser is crossed, a red LED and a shell message of "INTRUDER" is produced, and stays in this state until the password is entered into a keypad. Upon entry of the password, it will check if it is correct. If correct, the system will turn OFF, a yellow LED and a shell message of "System OFF" will be produced. Re-run the program to initiate the system to ON once more.
